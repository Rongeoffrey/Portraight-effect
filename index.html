            Say, I'm thinking 'bout her every second, every hour
            Do my singing in the shower
            Picking petals off the flowers like
            Do she love me, do she love me not? (love me not)
            I ain't a player, I just (Player, I just...)
            You give me that kind of something
            Want it all the time, need it everyday
            On a scale of one to ten I'm at a hundred
            Never get enough, I can't stay away
            If you want it, I got it, I got it everyday
            You can get whatever you need from me
            Stay by your side, I'll never leave you

            When you put your lips on mine
            And, honey, it ain't a question (Q-q-question)
            'Cause, boy, I know just what you like
            So if you need it, I got it, I got it everyday
            Be your lover, your friend, you'll find it all in me
